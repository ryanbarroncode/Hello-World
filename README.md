# Hello-World
Jan 8 2017 starting my new career.

My name is Ryan Barron, and i am from Greenville, SC. On december 27, 2014 i got married to Fallon Coponen.
Four months after being married we packed our bags and headed for Wasilla, Alaska. I lived there for two years, and recently i made the decision to switch careers and i made the call to The Iron Yard. I am extremely excited to be making this career change.
